<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by perorming the basic arithmetical, logical and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same</p>
<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3>
<p>In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and grapghics processing units (GPUs) accommodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a singlle component may contain a nuber of ALUs.</p>

<h3 id="c">C</h3>
<p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,[6] and used to re-implement the Unix operating system.[7] It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,[8][9] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<h3 id="c++">C++</h3>
<p>It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[6] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[6] including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[7] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>
<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>

<p>
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>
<h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3>
<p>RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued, unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML database management systems in the 1990s.[citation needed] However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.</p>
<h3 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h3>
<p>An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</p>
<h3 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h3>
<p>A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The type of a record defines which fields the record contains.</p>
<h3 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h3>
<p>The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.</p>
